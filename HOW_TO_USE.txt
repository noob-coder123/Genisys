  |NEW UPDATE||READ ONLY AFTER YOU'VE READ THE GUIDE|
  ---> tsadder.py major bug fixed
  HOW TO USE MANUALADD.PY
  You can manually add users. Choose an account, enter filename and the group then it'll add
  IMPORTANT- Before using manualadd.py, distribute CSV files based on number of accounts you wanna use
  using tsadder.py
  You can add from many accs at a time using manual. Its just like tsadder, but only difference is that its not
  automated. You can run the script from multiple accs at the same time
  For example-
    You launched manualadd.py and chose and account 'JOEY' to add users and you wanna run two accs
    Then do this-
        Relaunch manualadd.py. Don't close the previous window! It's adding users from JOEY acc
        Choose another account suppose MARK. Then you'll have two windows in total
        same script running from different accounts ;)
        DO NOT USE THE SAME CSV FILE. THAT'S Y I TOLD TO DISTRIBUTE FILES USING TSADDER

   |GOOD NEWS|
   ---------
   Though complete automation supports only windows, you can use manualadd.py in Termux(Android) or any
   other platform and add users from many accs at the same time!

  |NOTE|

  The folder is recommended to be stored in Desktop
  Install libraries by opening cmd in the 'Genisys' folder and typing
  >>> pip install -r requirements.txt

  |ABOUT|

  This is a simple guide that will help you to use this script properly

  ||STEPS TO USE||

  {MANAGER.py}

  1) For scraping and adding , you need Telegram accounts
   You can create new accounts in Telegram using virtual numbers

  2) After you've created accounts, goto my.telegram.org

  3) Perform user authentication

  4) After that, goto API Development Tools. Fill out the form. Lastly, click on 'Other' radiobutton
  then specify the reason in the textbox eg- 'App testing tool Telegram'

  5) When you proceed, you'll get API id, API hash. we require it for manager.py

  6) Now launch manager.py. Open cmd in the same location and type >>> python manager.py

  7) If you are using for the first time, you can go for the first option
  If you already have accounts and want to add new to existing, you can go for option 2

  8) Enter the values. If you wanna use more than one account then type 'y' and enter

----------  THE ACCOUNTS WILL BE STORED IN Vars.txt. DO NOT DELETE IT----------

  9) If you have banned accounts and wanna remove them, then choose banfilter option
  It'll intelligently remove all banned accounts and will update vars.txt
==========================================================================================================
  {SCRAPER.PY}

  1) Before adding, you need users to scrape from a public group
  2) So launch it in cmd
  >>> python scraper.py
  3) Enter username of the group from where you wanna scrape users
  Suppose the username is @this_group
  then enter 'this_group' in input[OMIT @]
  [NOTE] Scraper will use the first account specified in vars.txt
  [NOTE] The tool may ask for login code[only in first time login or no .session file]
  Scrapped accounts will be saved in members.csv
==========================================================================================================
  {TSADDER.PY}

  1) Now it's time to add users!
  2) Launch in cmd
  >>> python tsadder.py
  3) Firstly, master script will create sessions for all the accounts
  Enter required login code if it asks[you'll get in Tg app]
  4) It'll intelligently filter all banned accounts and will use only the active ones
  5) Next, same as scraper.py, it'll ask for public grp username. Enter the exact value
  [UNIQUE] Then it'll join the public group from all accounts and will remove any accs that are banned in that grp
  [RARE] After that, it'll divide values in members.csv into segments and will generate new CSV files according to 
  the number of accounts to be used
  Suppose I have 2 accounts, then members.csv will be redistributed into members0.csv and members1.csv
  6) NEXT, it'll ask for number of accounts to use. Recommended[10 if you have more than 10 accounts]
  7) Then it'll ask whether to add by username or by id. Choose the desired option
  |What is add by id|
  It means the users are added based on their user IDs. The entities are retrieved using their IDs
  |What is add by username|
  It means adding users based on their usernames. ONLY USERS HAVING USERNAMES WILL BE ADDED

  |IMPORTANT|

  TSADDER is a bit unusual. It retrieves users from members.csv and updates it. So if you run TSADDER many 
  times(maybe due to errors or something) you are basically losing members from members.csv
  You can scrape it again from the same group to get al the members

  |ATTENTION|

  AFTER STEP 7, READ WARNINGS CAREFULLY AND PROCEED. THIS WILL BE FULLY AUTOMATED.
  WHEN COUNTDOWN STARTS, STAY AWAY FROM KEYBOARD AND MOUSE [STAY AWAY FROM PC]
  MASTER SCRIPT WILL LAUNCH AS MANY CMD WINDOWS AS THE NUMBER OF ACCOUNTS USED
  WAIT TILL YOU HEAR A BEEP SOUND
  IF YOU DON'T HAVE SPEAKERS, WAIT TILL THE POP-UP STOPS
  FOR THIS, YOUR PC MUST NOT BE TOO LAGGY ELSE IT'LL FREEZE
  SO RECOMMENDED ACCOUNTS TO RUN AT ONCE IS 10
